# Google_Images_Compiler
With this project you can look for something in google and then recover it pictures from google images.

The program works correctly, but its not optimum. Im still working on it.

Things to do:
-More efficient scrolldown function
-Click on "show_More_Button" when it shows up, and keep scrolling
-Save the pictures instead of screenshot them
